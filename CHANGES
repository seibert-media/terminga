Release history for terminga

next
  [Fixed]
  - Don't mess with SIGCHLD, just reap children. This fixes error
    messages when using some terminals (VTE, for example).

v16  2024-01-19
  [Changed]
  - Group filtering has been extended. The config options are now called
    "host_groups" and "service_groups", and they are JSON lists. In
    other words, you can specify multiple filters now -- all filters
    will be queried and the results will be merged.

  [Added]
  - ACKs set an expiry date now.
  - The config options "default_ack_duration" and
    "default_downtime_duration" have been added.
  - Display of detailed output can be toggled now. Introduces config
    options "show_detailed_output_on_startup" and "size_of_item_area".
  - Detailed output can be scrolled.

v15  2023-01-10
  [Changed]
  - More stable scrolling: Instead of jumping back to the very first
    item on changes, we try to find the previously selected item or an
    item close to it.
  - The filter "show only selected items" has been removed. Nobody used
    this.

  [Added]
  - The config option "hide_ack_from_broken" has been added. This can
    restore pre-v10 behavior, if desired.
  - The config option "jump_to_first_unhandled" has been added.

v14  2021-07-13
  [Added]
  - Filters can be negative: "!foo" matches all items that do not
    contain "foo".

v13  2021-05-20
  [Fixed]
  - Fixed crash when displaying checks that never ran (still "pending"),
    if terminga proxy is not used.

  [Added]
  - Filtering via "group_filters" now also works if you're not using
    terminga-proxy.
  - The status bar shows the number of currently visible items.

v12  2021-02-25
  [Added]
  - "pass_command" can be used in your config instead of a plain text
    "password".

v11  2021-01-25
  [Fixed]
  - There's no longer a useless empty line above the bottom status bar
    if plugin output is empty.

  [Changed]
  - Filters have been reworked. It is no longer possible to search for
    custom variables. Instead, you should define host and service groups
    within Icinga -- support for filtering for those groups has been
    added.

v10  2020-12-11
  [Changed]
  - Items that have been ACKed are no longer hidden (like items in a
    downtime are). The idea is that these are unplanned incidents, which
    should be fixed -- and you should be aware of those incidents.

  [Added]
  - On empty search results or if there are simply no incidents to show,
    we now display an "everything is fine" string, instead of just
    showing a blank window.

v9  2020-08-14
  [Changed]
  - "a" and "A" add ACKs. Previously, "a" was "select all", this has
    been changed to "^A".

  [Added]
  - ACKs are now shown. They count as "not broken".

v8  2020-06-18
  [Changed]
  - Gracefully handle network connection errors.

v7  2020-05-15
  [Changed]
  - External tool: Interface has changed, see README. The tool will only
    be called once now, no matter how many items are selected. This
    allows you to work on multiple items at once.
  - Color scheme: Bar uses "white on blue" now, because it appears to
    be more compatible with different terminal color schemes.
  - Icinga Output: Output now wraps into multiple lines instead of
    overflowing into the void.

v6  2020-03-20
  [Fixed]
  - Backspace key now works in terminals other than XTerm, too.
  - Overly long check outputs can no longer use up the whole window
    space, nor do they overlap the currently selected item.

  [Changed]
  - Config ~/.terminga is now a JSON file.
  - On exceptions, terminga will now re-exec itself. This means that you
    can now install a new version with bug fixes while terminga is
    running.

  [Added]
  - Filter strings can now be passed to Icinga / terminga-proxy. Allows
    you to work on only those systems that match certain criteria.
  - A simple scroll indicator.

v5  2019-11-26
  [Added]
  - "v" pops the left-most filter.

v4  2019-10-30
  [Fixed]
  - We now only set 20 downtimes/re-checks in one API request. Icinga
    crashes with a segfault when we try to set 100.

v3  2019-09-30
  [Fixed]
  - Entering invalid regular expressions as filters no longer crashes
    the program.
  - Catch all exceptions on the outermost level, print them, then
    continue. This saves you the need to write a shell script as a
    wrapper.
  - Deselecting items originally selected with "a" has been fixed.

v2  2019-08-21
  [Fixed]
  - Selecting items and de-selecting them when "only show selected
    items" is active has been fixed.

  [Changed]
  - Actions (i.e., "set downtime" and "check now") now work on item
    under the cursor if nothing has been selected. (Previously, these
    actions worked on *all* items if nothing had been selected.)
  - "Set downtime" no longer has default values. Entering empty or
    invalid strings aborts.

  [Added]
  - Check output is shown in an extra pane.
  - Implement "check now".
  - "?" shows a help screen.
  - "Normal" keys like cursor keys work now.
  - "D" puts entire host in downtime.
  - "H" adds the host name of the currently selected item to the filter
    list, "S" does the same for the service name.
  - "e" runs an external program on selected items.
  - Show some mode indicators and a progress bar that shows the time
    until next auto-refresh.
  - Soft states are now indicated by "S".

v1  2019-08-12
  - This is the initial release of terminga.
